## What?
List of specific questions and answers.

## Why?
This will act as a **reminder** of what we have covered in our **development journey**. Also, to act as a reference point for future requirements.  

## How?
Simply create an issue with specific question. If you know the answer of your question you can assign someone else to encourage their learning expierence. You can also answer your own question if you feel like you can offer a better perspective or you are not sure of the answer yourself. 

Don't forget to add a **label** that corresponds to the question. If the label for your question doesn't exist feel free to create one.
